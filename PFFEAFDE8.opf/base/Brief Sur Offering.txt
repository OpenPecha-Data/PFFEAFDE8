Brief Sur Offering
by Dudjom Rinpoche

om ah hung
oṃ āḥ hūṃ
sur chö döyön gyatsö trinpung di
This sur offering, billowing clouds of oceanic sensory enjoyments,
könchok tsa sum sishyü drön la bul
I offer to the Three Jewels and Three Roots, the guests invited out of respect.
tsok dzok drib jang tukjé kyab tu sol
Protect me in your compassion, I pray, and cause me to complete the accumulations and purify
my obscurations!
damchen chökyong yönten drön la bul
I offer to the oath-bound dharma protectors, guests invited on account of their qualities:
nyé shing tsim né chi nang barché sol
May you be pleased and satisfied and dispel all outer and inner obstacles!
rik druk semchen nyingjé drön la ngo
I offer to the sentient beings of the six classes, guests invited out of compassion:
dukngal kündral zakmé dé tob shok
May you be free from all forms of suffering and gain immaculate bliss!
dön gek lha dré lenchak drön la ngo
I dedicate to harmful influences, obstructing forces, gods and spirits, the guests to whom I
owe karmic debts:
nö tsé sem shyi pendé tsowar shok
May all violence and malevolence be pacified and may you live happily and beneficially.
khordé drön rik mikmé zangtal ngang
In a state of unimpeded openness, beyond any focus on the various guests in saṃsāra or nirvāṇa,
khor sum yong dak chöying long drol shok
May we be liberated in the dharmadhātu expanse that is entirely free of the three conceptual
spheres.

By Jigdral Yeshe Dorje.
