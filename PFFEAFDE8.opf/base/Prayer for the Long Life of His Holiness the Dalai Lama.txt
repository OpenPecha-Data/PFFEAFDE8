Prayer for the Long Life of His Holiness the Dalai Lama
by Kyabje Dudjom Rinpoche

tendzin gyu kar jewé ü nyi na
Amidst a billionfold constellations of holders of the teachings,
da mé khyen tsé yeshé ötreng chen
You are incomparable, like a radiant sun of wisdom and love,
gang chenpé tsön sipa lho ling gi
A guardian for those in the Land of Snows and all who dwell
lü chen gyatsö gön khyö shyap ten söl
On this southern continent of Jambudvīpa—may your life be secure, I pray!
Thus the devoted Dudjom (Destroyer of Māras) prayed. Siddhirastu!
