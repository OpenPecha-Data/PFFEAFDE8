Brief Red Sur
by Dudjom Rinpoche

om ah hung
oṃ āḥ hūṃ
tokmé ngardzin bakchak kyi
Arisen from the habit of clinging to an 'I' throughout beginningless time,
duk nga trukpé rang zuk ni
Which stirs up the five poisons, so that they take on various forms—
gyalgong damsi mo dré sok
The gyalgong spirits, damsi demons, female ghosts and the rest;
dom shor damnyam nösem chen
Those with broken vows and commitments and those with malice,
taktu shyen la tsé jé ching
Who are forever doing harm to others,
namkar drub la bardu chö
Disrupting the accomplishment of wholesome acts,
lo gyur khön tab pung na dren
Causing caprice, quarrelling and bringing ruin;
zé nor longchö pal la ku
Stealing food, wealth, possessions and glory,
chishyin drangwé gab dré rik
Together with the concealed spirits who stalk and pursue—
lenchak drön gyur tamché la
To all you guests to whom I owe karmic debts,
sha trak lasok khogü dzé
I present these substances that you crave, such as flesh and blood,
dögur charwé dri sur trin
And clouds of fragrant burnt offering which arise as all that is desirable,
namkha dzö du trö jé té
Increasing and expanding to become a treasury of space,
pam gyal tabtsö mepar ngo
And dedicated to you all beyond dispute as to loss or gain.
gagu yirang tsim gyur né
As you are enlivened and satisfied with every possible delight,
bulön lenchak shakhön jang
May all my dues, karmic debts and bonds of vengeance be purified.
gyü la changchub sem kyé té
May the spirit of awakening arise within your minds,
tarpé dewa tob gyur chik
And may you discover the bliss of liberation.
den nyi luwa mepé tü
Through the force of the unfailing two truths,
mönlam yongsu drubpar shok
May these prayers of aspiration be perfectly fulfilled!

Give the gift of dharma, perform the dedication and so on.

Composed for Trulshik Dorje by Jigdral Yeshe Dorje.
