Divine Blue Water
A Contamination-Purifying Smoke Offering
by the Great Master Padmasambhava
edited by Dudjom Rinpoche Jikdral Yeshé Dorjé

Padmasambhavāya Namaḥ
When the master Padmsambhava was practicing at Samye Chimpu cave, King Trisong Deutsen had been
unwell for a long time. Throughout the land there was famine, blight, frost and hail,
along with epidemics and many other bad omens. After much discussion, the ministers called
those who were necessary—a doctor, a diviner, and an astrologer. The doctor checked the king’s
pulse and said, “This is not a pulse of any disease of the four humours. There is a
submerged, clouded channel;1 thus it is probably an illness caused by impurity.” After this,
the diviner performed a divination and the astrologer made calculations. They all agreed
that the king and all the local deities had become agitated by some impure contamination
pollution, but neither doctor nor diviner nor astrologer, nor anyone else had any idea what
causes and conditions had brought about the contamination. As for the activities of King
Trisong Deutsen’s queen, Mongza Tricham, she had given birth to a contaminated child.2 The
queen secretly handed the baby over to a servant woman, saying: “It is of the upmost importance
that you hide this without anyone seeing you.” The servant buried the baby’s corpse
in the ground. Because the corpse came into contact with the belly of the earth deity who
presided over that place, the owner of the land and all the local deities were struck down
by pollution and impurity, becoming agitated. Hence, the king and his realm had become
unwell.The servant woman also fell ill—stricken and polluted. She developed rheumatism in
her head and limbs. A doctor was called and consulted. “This is not a disease of the four
humours,” he said. “You have been struck by some impure contamination pollution, but I do
not know what type of contamination this is and so I have no means to cure your illness.”
Then the servant explained in detail how she had hid Tricham’s baby. This story spread from
one person to another until it reached the king’s ear. The king called Tricham and asked
her about it. Tricham thought, “This will put the servant’s life in danger,” so she did
not tell the truth. The king was angry and thought he would punish Tricham, but Tricham went
to Orgyen Rinpoche to beg for protection. Orgyen Rinpoche wrote a letter to the king, and
sent it to him, along with a blessed knot:“It seems you are thinking of punishing Queen
Tricham. However, I am a yogi who realizes that appearances are not real. Because I know
that all these various appearances come about through dependent origination, I have the power
to eliminate not only this impure contamination pollution, but the pollution of the mental
afflictions—the five poisons—as well. I have a purification method that is easy to perform,
with few words and great benefit. Please now gather together all the substances and
equipment that you will need. Do not worry, King. Come tomorrow with your ministers and retinue
to the summit of Samyé Hepo Ri.”The king was very pleased. He gathered the substances
and equipment, and the next day he went to the top of Hepo Ri Mountain. The great master
was there. He put all the substances that the king had brought into a large, spacious container
and, as they burned, he recited this ritual:

Having spoken thus, he said: “King, ministers, and retinue—have no doubt! It is beneficial to
practice this.”Then the king, ministers, and retinue rejoiced, feeling pleased and happy.
Offering a maṇḍala of gold, they prostrated, circumambulated, and said: “Kyé! Great master,
how do we continue to practice, and for what purpose?”The great master said: “Kyé! Great
King, you must do something meaningful with this human body that you have obtained, which
has the freedoms and riches. The way to do this is to create the causes for enlightenment
by supplicating the worldly and world-transcending deities and guardians.“They will then
clear away obstacles and circumstances that impede the accomplishment of enlightenment,
and they will create the proper circumstances for both sublime and common spiritual accomplishment.
This is why you must serve the deities and guardians.“Making purifying smoke offerings
will purify the contamination from the pollution of the mental afflictions, the five
poisons, and it is a method for surrounding yourself with deities and guardians so that
they will never be separate from you. This is the purpose of continually making purifying
smoke offerings.“In particular, the method for quickly eliminating impurity and contamination
pollution is to make purifying smoke offerings to the deities in the morning and in the
evening to do the contamination purifying smoke offering and the contamination cleansing
ceremony. If you do this, all pollution and impurity will be dispelled. The deities and guardians
will surround you. You will be blessed with food, wealth, and luxury. The humours
of the body will be in balance. You will be glowing and radiant. Your constitution and senses
will be bright. You will be pleasing to everyone. The worldly gods and spirits will obey
you. You will not be sullied by the stains of obstacles and counterproductive circumstances
and you will be endowed with many good qualities.”The king said: “Very good, Great Master!
How does one perform the contamination cleansing ceremony?”The great master said: “The
traditions of sūtra and tantra have their own particular contamination cleansing ceremonies.
There are many different ingredients, preparations and so on. However, in this case,
the medicinal substances already mentioned should be mixed with various perfumes in clean
water and poured into a precious vase. Sprinkle the water in all directions of the locale;
this is the cleansing of the place. Also, by this method, you can cleanse the representations
of enlightened body, speech, and mind; that is the cleansing of representations.“If
epidemics spread among people, livestock and so forth, cleanse the contamination pollution
while identifying with Vajravidāranā, wrathful Bhurkuṃkūṭa, Amṛtakuṇḍalī and so on.“If
wealth substances are polluted, it is sufficient to sprinkle the cleansing water on them.”Pleased,
the great king reverently joined his palms and did many prostrations and circumambulations.
Then he returned to the palace. It wasn’t long before the king’s illness passed
and there were many auspicious omens in the regions of Tibet.Here ends the text called Divine
Blue Water: The Contamination-purifying Smoke Offering Performed by The Great Master
Padmasambhava.This contamination-purifying smoke offering and the purifying smoke offering
called The Source of Bounty and Happiness were not hidden as treasures. They were painted
on the outer wall of Pehar Kordzöling, and thus are known as the Samyé mural. From there,
the textual lineage spread widely in Ü and Tsang. In particular, the master Vairocana took
the text with him when he went to Gyalmo Tsawarong. On the way, in Kham, he gave it to
Diri Chökyi Dragpa. Since then, the lineage has spread and flourished throughout Kham until
the present day. Sarva Maṅgalam.Many learned as well as uneducated village ngakpas have
passed on this textual lineage by reciting it and writing it out by hand. Thus, there are
slight variations in the wording of different versions. Using a few correct texts as a basis,
I, Jigdral Yeshé Dorjé, have attempted to carefully edit this so as to increase the number
of good copies. Virtue!

goddess of maternity, who influences the birth of children.”
