The Brief Tsok Feast Offering Prayer from 'The Profound Path of the Ḍākinīs' Heart Drop'
a terma revealed by Kyabjé Dudjom Rinpoche, Jikdral Yeshé Dorjé

ram yam kham | om ah hung
raṃ yaṃ khaṃ | oṃ āḥ hūṃ
ying kyi bhendhar rigpé tsoktor sham
In the skull of all-pervading space, the torma feast of rigpa is arranged,
drön druk jazer tiklé döyön tra
The sensual stimulants shine and sparkle as the rainbow rays and tiklé of the six lights;
ngotsar sam mi khyabpé damtsik di
This wondrous samaya, beyond all imagining,
rangrig tsawa sum gyi lhatsok la
To all the gurus, devas and ḍākinīs, who are my very own rigpa,
nyimé nyampé ngang du chöpa bul
I offer from within the non-dual state of equanimity.
tokpé drazur tiklé chenpor shak
All the limitations of conceptual thought I confess in the great tiklé,
zungdzin dragek kyemé ying su drol
Subject and object, the enemies who obstruct, are liberated into unborn space,
trulnang shyitok sepé trinlé drub
The activity of awakening delusory appearances into original awareness is accomplished.
lhündrub nang shyi yeshe tarchin né
Having reached the ultimate wisdom of the four visions of spontaneous perfection,
kadak shyönnu bumkur changchub shok
May I attain enlightenment in the youthful vase body of primordial purity!

It was the eighteenth day of the first month of the Fire Mouse year (1936), and I Jikdral Yeshé
Dorjé, in my thirty-third year, lay sick, while the Dzogchen adept Trulshik Dorjé was
performing a hundred tsok feast and fulfilment practices of the ḍākinīs in order to ward off
my illness. Early the next morning, in my dreams, a woman spoke these words very distinctly.
As I heard them, I awoke, and, without forgetting them, I put these delusory perceptions
into writing. The following day, as an auspicious sign, my illness disappeared completely.
