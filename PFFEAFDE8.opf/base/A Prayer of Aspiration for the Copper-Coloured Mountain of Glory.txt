A Prayer of Aspiration for the Copper-Coloured Mountain of Glory
by Dudjom Rinpoche

sangye kün gyi ngowo kadrinchen
Heart of all buddhas, compassionate one,
orgyen rinpoche la solwa deb
Orgyen Rinpoche, I call on you and pray:
namshyik tsé di nangwa nub matak
The very instant the perceptions of this life fade away,
pema ö du kyewar jingyi lob
Bless me, with your grace, to be born in your paradise of Lotus Light!

By Jñāna.
