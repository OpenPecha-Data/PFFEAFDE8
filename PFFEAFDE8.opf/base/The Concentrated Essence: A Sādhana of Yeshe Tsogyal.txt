The Concentrated Essence
A Sādhana of Yeshe Tsogyal
by Dudjom Rinpoche

lama yeshe khandromar
In the guru and the wisdom ḍākinī I take refuge;
kyab chi dro dön changsem kyé
And for beings’ sake, I generate bodhicitta.
rangnyi kechik dren dzok su
Perfect in the moment of recollection,
dorjé naljor tsogyal kur
I am Vajrayoginī in the form of Yeshe Tsogyal.
salwé tuk sok ngak treng lé
From the mantra garland at my heart’s vital core,
özer trodü dön nyi jé
Rays of light emanate and return, bringing twofold benefit.
nang drak lha ngak chönyi ngang
Appearances and sound are deity and mantra in the state of dharmatā,
dechen tiklé chik tu khyil
And everything coalesces within a single sphere of perfect bliss.
om jnana dakini bam harinisa siddhi hung
oṃ jñāna ḍākinī baṃ harinisa siddhi hūṃ
kyepé nangcha tongpar sé
Generated appearances are awakened into emptiness,
tongpé rang tsal lha ru shar
And emptiness’s own inherent energy arises as the deity.
dir bé sönam dro la ngo
Any merit gained through these exertions, I dedicate to beings.
dön nyi lhündrub trashi shok
May all be auspicious so that twofold benefit is spontaneously accomplished!

Jñāna wrote this as a convenient form of practice for some devoted American students, male and
female.
