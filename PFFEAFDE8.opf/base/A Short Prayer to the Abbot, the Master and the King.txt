So may the long-standing tradition of these three, the immaculate Ancient Translations,
ling shyi khyön kün tak khyab pelgyé shok
Forever grow, expand, and entirely fill the four continents of the world!

In order to fulfil the wish of the noble son Thinley Norbu, I, Jikdral Yeshé Dorjé, wrote this
prayer in the monastery of Glorious Samyé, the Unchanging, Spontaneously Accomplished.
May it only bring virtue!
