Summary of Striking the Vital Point in Three Statements
by Kyabje Dudjom Rinpoche

ngo rang tok tu tré
Introducing directly the face of rigpa in itself.
Introducing directly the face of the naked mind as the rigpa itself, the innate primordial wisdom.
tak chik tok tu ché
Decision complete and direct in certainty.
Because all phenomena, whatever manifests, whether saṃsāra or nirvāṇa, are none other than the
rigpa’s own play, there is complete and direct decision that there is nothing other than
the abiding of the continual flow of rigpa.
deng drol tok tu cha
Confidence directly in the dissolution of namtok (arising thoughts).
In the recognition of namtok, whatever arises, whether gross or subtle, there is direct confidence
in the simultaneity of the arising and dissolution in the expanse of dharmakāya, which
is the unity of rigpa and śūnyatā.
by Dudjom Rinpoche, 1976.
