Through the power of the ocean-like, unfailing sources of refuge,
jikmé tubten trinlé palbar gyi
May Jikmé Tubten Trinlé Palbar’s
shyabpé mishik kal gyar rabten né
Lotus feet remain indestructible and stable for hundreds of aeons,
lab chen ten drö shyedön tarchin shok
And may he accomplish his vast purpose for the teaching and for sentient beings!

In accordance with a request, accompanied by the gift of a precious silken scarf, from the renunciant
Lama Changchub Dorje, Jikdral Yeshe Dorje wrote this as a prayer of aspiration for
the long life of Dodrupchen Rinpoche. Siddhirastu!
