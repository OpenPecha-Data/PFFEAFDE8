Drumbeat of the Deathless Vajra
A Fervent Invocation and Prayer
by Dudjom Rinpoche

möden dak gi gönchok kadrinchen
Gracious, supreme guardian of mine,
tsa sum kündü chimé pemajung
Embodiment of the three roots, deathless Padmasambhava,
chik chok kyap su shepé khyö nyen na
As I, your devoted disciple, approach you, knowing you to be the all-sufficient refuge,
tukjé nyé ring drelwé drelmé kyong
Nurture me, never leaving, with unbiased compassion!

dümin chi sok barché nyé kün shyi
Pacify all obstacles and faults, such as untimely death!
ringpor tso sok dödön yishyin drup
Fulfil all my wishes, such as living long!
tendror menpé samjor tarchin né
Bless me that, perfecting the intentions and actions that aid the teachings and beings,
gön khyö gongpa kong nü jin gyi lop
I may be able to fulfil your awakened intent!

rang rik dön gyi tsedak pejung hrih
Longevity’s ultimate sovereign is self-awareness, Padmasambhava,
nying ü nyidé ga’ur lhenkyé su
With hrīḥ, the very life-force of vajra-wisdom essence,
dö né yeshé dorjé nyingpö sok
Naturally, primordially present within his heart centre
tak ten pogyur drel di emaho
In an orb of sun and moon, permanent, stable, and unchanging—how amazing this is!

When I had the great good fortune to engage in profound longevity practice in the cave at Māratika,
the supreme sacred place where the Great Master of Uḍḍiyāna, single embodiment of
all buddha families, himself manifested the deathless vajra body, I, Jikdrel Yeshé Dorjé,
spontaneously proclaimed this prayer with fervent devotion and, seeing excellent signs indicating
that it contains immense blessings, I wrote it down. May it bring goodness!
